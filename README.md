This repo holds scripts that automate processes I use when creating new servers in my homelab or from cloud providers.
Automated_Setup.py file creates a wireguard VPN configuration on my management VPN server and enables it as a systemd daemon on the new server.

You will need to change Config-Example.py to Config.py and insert your own info in place of the defaults before execution.
